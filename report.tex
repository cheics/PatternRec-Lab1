\section{Conclusions}
Implementation of five classifiers (MED, GED, MAP, NN, and 5NN) in MATLAB was used to analyze the performance of each classifier. First, each method was implemented and used to classify a two-class and three-class data set. The classifiers were used to determine decision boundaries in each case, resulting in some initial observations about model performance. Overall, MED performed poorly, with GED and MAP classifiers performing significantly better. It was also seen that the 5NN classifier outperformed the NN classifier in rejecting statistical outliers in the data.

As noted in the earlier error analysis, MAP outperformed the MED, GED, NN, and 5NN classifiers in the scenario of Case 1. This is because MAP inherently attempts to minimize the probability of error, resulting in it outperforming other classifiers in terms of probability of error. MED does not consider the probability of error, or the covariance of the data, and therefore performs relatively poorly. GED performs significantly better than MED for Case 1, and almost performs at the level of the MAP classifier. This is because GED considers the covariance of each class of data, though unlike MAP it does not consider the probability of error. The NN and 5NN classifiers are markedly outperformed by the other techniques, a result of them poorly classifying the new set of test data.

In the scenario of Case 2 the probability of error increased significantly for all classifiers. However, the same trend of MAP outperforming GED and MED, and GED outperforming MED, was conserved. It is notable in this case, however, that the performance of the NN and 5NN classifiers was competitive with other methods. The 5NN method still performed better than the NN method, due to it's ability to reject outliers. The improvement in performance of the 5NN and NN techniques here is likely due to both methods being able to account for the number of data points in each class and adjust accordingly - something the other classifiers are unable to accomplish.
